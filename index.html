      The actual Muslim wedding is known as a Nikkah. It is a simple ceremony, at which the bride does not have to be present so long as she sends two witnesses to the drawn-up agreement. Normally, the ceremony consists of reading from the Qur'an, and the exchange of vows in front of witnesses for both partners.

      The Mehndi ceremony is all about adorning the bride's hands and feet with intricate henna designs, symbolizing love, happiness, and prosperity.Henna is put on on the hands and the feet of the bride, a night before the wedding, where it is believed to cool the body's nerve-endings while keeping the bride calm throughout her big day.

      A Barat is the groom's procession into the wedding ceremony. The procession signifies an age-old tradition of the groom who would travel an average of five to seven days to his bride to be home. Nowadays, the baraat is condensed to up to an hour of dancing and celebration.

      The walima is used as a symbol to show domestic happiness in the household post-marriage. As per sharia, the walima only takes place where the groom resides (which is also the new location for the bride). It is from the groom's side as a token of appreciation after the couple have met in isolation.
